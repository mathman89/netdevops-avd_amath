Requirements to use this example:

- Follow the [installation guide](../../../../../docs/installation/collection-installation.md) for AVD
- Run the following playbook to copy the AVD **examples** to your current working directory, for example `ansible-avd-examples`:

```shell
ansible-playbook arista.avd.install_examples
```

This will show the following:

```shell
 ~/ansible-avd-examples# ansible-playbook arista.avd.install_examples

PLAY [Install Examples]**********************************************************************************************

TASK [Copy all examples to ~/ansible-avd-examples]*******************************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP

localhost                  : ok=1    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

After the playbook has run successfully, the directory structure of the example should look like below, the contents of which will be covered in later sections:
